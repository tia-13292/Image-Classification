# Categorizing Faces based on Emotions

The data encompasses 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces with different expressions. Each face is positioned in the center, occupying the same amount of space as in other images. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotions into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

Fer2013.csv (a file consisting of data sets about different facial expressions) contains two columns, "emotion" and "pixels". The "emotion" column contains a numeric code ranging from 0 to 6, each code representative of an emotion as mentioned above. The "pixels" column, on the other hand, contains a string surrounded by quotes for each image.

The data set consists of 28,709 examples. This data set was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part of an ongoing research project. They have graciously provided the workshop organizers with a preliminary version of their dataset
